# Saliency-Guided Surveillance

## üìñ Overview

**Saliency-Guided Surveillance** is a project aimed at enhancing object detection in surveillance systems by integrating saliency detection mechanisms. By focusing computational resources on the most informative regions of an image, the system improves detection accuracy and efficiency.

## üß† Motivation

Traditional object detection systems process entire images, which can be computationally intensive and may include irrelevant background information. By guiding the detection process using saliency maps‚Äîhighlighting regions of interest‚Äîthe system can:

- Reduce computational load
- Improve detection accuracy
- Enhance real-time processing capabilities

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`Application/`**: Contains scripts and notebooks for deploying the saliency-guided detection system in real-world scenarios.

- **`Multi modal Fusion/`**: Implements techniques for combining information from multiple modalities (e.g., RGB and infrared images) to improve detection performance.

- **`Object Detection/`**: Includes models and code related to object detection algorithms used in the project.

- **`Saliency Detection/`**: Contains models and scripts for generating saliency maps from input images.

- **`Saliency Guided Detection/`**: Integrates saliency maps with object detection models to focus on regions of interest.

- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview and guide to the repository.
